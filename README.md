# RE-SUBMISSION - My Portfolio Week 1

## Sospeter Kung'u

### Description of My Portfolio Week 1
My portfolio contains all the things I have covered in the first week of programming in Moringa School online class which began on 20th April 2020 and ended on  Friday 24th April 2020. Although an initial submission was relayed on Friday 24th April 2020, this re-submission is meant to show the same project redone to the the standards expected as per week 1 IP guidelines. This is due to the fact that by the date of initial submission, the programmer had lagged behind in lessons and could not submit a complete project as instructed by the same guidelines. 

### Set-up and installation
To run this project needs basic programming tools like
    Git
    GitHub
    Atom
    any web browser
The know how to use the above tools is vital so as to check the code has been written correctly with all commits noted.
